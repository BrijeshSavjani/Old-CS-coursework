<h1>Top Trumps</h1>

The goal here was to create an object orientated version of the Top Trumps game. This game should have been object orientated. I suceeded in the project. We also had to make a 
Report detailing our thought process and development. I havce also included this. This <b>MUST</b> be run on Visual Studio 2019 Preview with .NET 5.This is because I used a switch
case that has an inequality.

<h5>Set up</h5>
As I made this about my teachers I have removed any personal details about them including names and sketches/images. To get the full experience I would recommend that you set it up
with details on your teachers. Don't worry abouyt the images as if an image is not provided then it defaults back to a blank profile image.
